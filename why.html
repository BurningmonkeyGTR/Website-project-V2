    <p>The case for this remake is a simple one, more emulated copies of the game are in circulation than original copies, and the original copies like the one below go for in excess of Â£100.</p>

    <p>This is clearly a game with a dedicated following who would buy a remake in droves if done right, and the marketing opportunities for special editions with figurines of the characters or models of the various ships in the game is extremely high. The original game was also among the first to implement add-on content and many fans would happily play a well written expansion or appreciate more options for personalising their bases.</p>
